# Youtube Repeat Player

A web extension that converts your Youtube tab in your browser into a music player.

There are a couple of extensions already out there that allow you to repeat YouTube videos. How is it different from the YouTube loop feature? You can set the start and stop time yourself in the video to avoid listening to any unnecessary part in the music video. But all those extensions are limited to the repeat feature only. 

Our extension allows you to create playlists, save the state of the song(the starting point and the end point), share your playlist with the other extension users, and get recommendations on what is hot in the YouTube music scene right now. The best part is you don't have to pay any subscription fee to listen to all the free music out there on YouTube. 

### Here is the list of the features that the extension will provide: 
* 1. Convert the YouTube tab in your browser into a music player. 
* 2. Watch song videos (or any video on repeat by setting a start and stop point) 
* 3. Save the state of the song videos in the local storage of your browser individually or as a playlist. 
* 4. Share your playlist with other users and get recommended songs and playlists.
